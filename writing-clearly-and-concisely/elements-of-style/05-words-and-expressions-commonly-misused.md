# V. Words And Expressions Commonly Misused

Some of the forms here listed are downright bad English; others have their defenders but are in such general disfavor that it is inadvisable to use them; still others are good in their place but constantly obtrude themselves into places where they have no right to be.

If the writer will make it his purpose from the beginning to express accurately his own individual thought, and will refuse to be satisfied with a ready-made formula, these expressions will cause him little trouble.

## Common Errors

**All right.** Always written as two words.

**As good or better than.** Rearrange: "My opinion is as good as his, or better."

**As to whether.** *Whether* is sufficient.

**But.** Unnecessary after *doubt* and *help*: "I have no doubt that" (not "but that").

**Can.** Means *am able*. Not to be used as a substitute for *may*.

**Case.** Usually unnecessary: "Many of the rooms were poorly ventilated" (not "In many cases, the rooms were poorly ventilated").

**Character.** Often redundant: "Hostile acts" (not "Acts of a hostile character").

**Compare.** *Compare to* points out resemblances between different orders; *compare with* points out differences between same order.

**Data.** A plural: "These data were tabulated."

**Different than.** Not permissible. Use *different from*.

**Due to.** Incorrectly used for *because of* in adverbial phrases.

**Effect.** As noun, means *result*; as verb, means *to bring about* (not to be confused with *affect*, which means "to influence").

**Etc.** Not to be used if the reader would be left in doubt as to important particulars.

**Fact.** Use only of matters capable of direct verification, not of matters of judgment.

**Factor.** Hackneyed; usually replaceable: "He won the match by being better trained" (not "His superior training was the great factor").

**Feature.** Hackneyed; usually adds nothing.

**He is a man who.** Redundant: "He is very ambitious" (not "He is a man who is very ambitious").

**However.** In the meaning *nevertheless*, not to come first in its sentence.

**Interesting.** Avoid as perfunctory introduction. Make it interesting instead of announcing it.

**Kind of.** Not to be used for *rather*. Same for *sort of*.

**Less.** Should not be misused for *fewer*. *Less* refers to quantity, *fewer* to number.

**Like.** Not to be misused for *as*. *Like* governs nouns and pronouns; before phrases and clauses use *as*.

**Line, along these lines.** Overworked; discard entirely.

**Literal, literally.** Often incorrectly used to support exaggeration: "A flood of abuse" (not "A literal flood").

**Most.** Not to be used for *almost*: "Almost everybody" (not "Most everybody").

**Nature.** Often redundant, like *character*.

**One of the most.** Avoid beginning essays with this threadbare formula.

**Participle for verbal noun.** "Do you mind my asking?" (not "me asking").

**People.** A political term, not to be confused with *the public*.

**Phase.** Means a stage of transition. Not to be used for *aspect* or *topic*.

**Possess.** Not a mere substitute for *have* or *own*.

**Respective, respectively.** Usually omittable.

**Shall, Will.** Future tense requires *shall* for first person, *will* for second and third.

**So.** Avoid as an intensifier: "so good," "so warm."

**Split Infinitive.** In disfavor; avoid: "To inquire diligently" (not "To diligently inquire").

**State.** Not a mere substitute for *say*. Restrict to *express fully or clearly*.

**Student Body.** Needless; use *students*.

**System.** Frequently used without need: "Dormitories" (not "The dormitory system").

**They.** Do not use plural pronoun when antecedent is *each*, *everybody*, *anyone*, etc.

**Very.** Use sparingly. Where emphasis is necessary, use words strong in themselves.

**Viewpoint.** Write *point of view*, but do not misuse for *view* or *opinion*.

**While.** Avoid indiscriminate use for *and*, *but*, *although*. Best used literally: *during the time that*.

**Whom.** Often incorrectly used for *who* before "he said" when it is the subject of a following verb.

**Worth while.** Overworked. Strictly applicable only to actions.

**Would.** Conditional statements in first person require *should*, not *would*.
