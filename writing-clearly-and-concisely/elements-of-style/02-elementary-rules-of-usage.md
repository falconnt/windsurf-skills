# II. Elementary Rules Of Usage

## Rule 1. Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.

Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write:

- Charles's friend
- Burns's poems
- the witch's malice

This is the usage of the United States Government Printing Office and of the Oxford University Press.

**Exceptions:** the possessive of ancient proper names in *-es* and *-is*, the possessive *Jesus'*, and such forms as *for conscience' sake*, *for righteousness' sake*. But such forms as *Achilles' heel*, *Moses' laws*, *Isis' temple* are commonly replaced by:

- the heel of Achilles
- the laws of Moses
- the temple of Isis

The pronominal possessives *hers*, *its*, *theirs*, *yours*, and *oneself* have no apostrophe.

## Rule 2. In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last.

Thus write:

- red, white, and blue
- gold, silver, or copper
- He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents.

In the names of business firms the last comma is omitted, as: Brown, Shipley & Co.

## Rule 3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas.

> The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel on foot.

This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether a single word, such as *however*, or a brief phrase, is or is not parenthetic. If the interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight, the writer may safely omit the commas. But whether the interruption be slight or considerable, he must never insert one comma and omit the other.

**Indefensible punctuation:**

- Marjorie's husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday,
- My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health,

If a parenthetic expression is preceded by a conjunction, place the first comma before the conjunction, not after it.

> He saw us coming, and unaware that we had learned of his treachery, greeted us with a smile.

**Always parenthetic and enclosed between commas:**

1. The year, when forming part of a date, and the day of the month, when following the day of the week:
   - February to July, 1916.
   - April 6, 1917.
   - Monday, November 11, 1918.

2. The abbreviations *etc.* and *jr.*

3. Non-restrictive relative clauses (those which do not serve to identify or define the antecedent noun):

> The audience, which had at first been indifferent, became more and more interested.

Compare the restrictive relative clause, not set off by commas:

> The candidate who best meets these requirements will obtain the place.

## Rule 4. Place a comma before a conjunction introducing a co-ordinate clause.

> The early records of the city have disappeared, and the story of its first years can no longer be reconstructed.

> The situation is perilous, but there is still one chance of escape.

Two-part sentences of which the second member is introduced by *as* (in the sense of *because*), *for*, *or*, *nor*, and *while* (in the sense of *and at the same time*) likewise require a comma before the conjunction.

If the second member is introduced by an adverb, a semicolon, not a comma, is required (see Rule 5).

| Original | Revision |
| --- | --- |
| I had never been in the place before; so I had difficulty in finding my way about. | As I had never been in the place before, I had difficulty in finding my way about. |

When the subject is the same for both clauses and is expressed only once, a comma is required if the connective is *but*. If the connective is *and*, the comma should be omitted if the relation between the two statements is close or immediate.

- I have heard his arguments, but am still unconvinced.
- He has had several years' experience and is thoroughly competent.

## Rule 5. Do not join independent clauses by a comma.

If two or more clauses, grammatically complete and not joined by a conjunction, are to form a single compound sentence, the proper mark of punctuation is a semicolon.

> Stevenson's romances are entertaining; they are full of exciting adventures.

> It is nearly half past five; we cannot reach town before dark.

If a conjunction is inserted the proper mark is a comma (Rule 4).

> Stevenson's romances are entertaining, for they are full of exciting adventures.

**Two exceptions:**

1. If the clauses are very short, and are alike in form, a comma is usually permissible:
   - Man proposes, God disposes.
   - The gate swung apart, the bridge fell, the portcullis was drawn up.

2. In the colloquial form: "I hardly knew him, he was so changed" — but this is inappropriate in formal writing.

## Rule 6. Do not break sentences in two.

In other words, do not use periods for commas.

| Wrong | Right |
| --- | --- |
| I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago. Coming home from Liverpool to New York. | I met them on a Cunard liner several years ago, coming home from Liverpool to New York. |
| He was an interesting talker. A man who had traveled all over the world. | He was an interesting talker, a man who had traveled all over the world. |

It is permissible to make an emphatic word or expression serve the purpose of a sentence:

> Again and again he called out. No reply.

The writer must be certain that the emphasis is warranted.

## Rule 7. A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.

> Walking slowly down the road, he saw a woman accompanied by two children.

The word *walking* refers to the subject of the sentence, not to the woman.

| Original | Revision |
| --- | --- |
| On arriving in Chicago, his friends met him at the station. | When he arrived in Chicago, his friends met him at the station. |
| A soldier of proved valor, they entrusted him with the defence of the city. | A soldier of proved valor, he was entrusted with the defence of the city. |
| Young and inexperienced, the task seemed easy to me. | Young and inexperienced, I thought the task easy. |

**Sentences violating this rule are often ludicrous:**

- Being in a dilapidated condition, I was able to buy the house very cheap.
- Wondering irresolutely what to do next, the clock struck twelve.
