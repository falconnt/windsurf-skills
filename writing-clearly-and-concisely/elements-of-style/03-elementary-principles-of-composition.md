# III. Elementary Principles Of Composition

## Rule 8. Make the paragraph the unit of composition: one paragraph to each topic.

If the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent, or if you intend to treat it very briefly, there may be no need of subdividing it into topics. Thus a brief description, a brief summary of a literary work, a brief account of a single incident, a narrative merely outlining an action, the setting forth of a single idea, any one of these is best written in a single paragraph.

Ordinarily, however, a subject requires subdivision into topics, each of which should be made the subject of a paragraph. The object of treating each topic in a paragraph by itself is to aid the reader. The beginning of each paragraph is a signal that a new step in the development of the subject has been reached.

As a rule, single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs.

## Rule 9. As a rule, begin each paragraph with a topic sentence, end it in conformity with the beginning.

The object is to aid the reader. The practice enables him to discover the purpose of each paragraph as he begins to read it, and to retain this purpose in mind as he ends it.

The most generally useful kind of paragraph, particularly in exposition and argument, is that in which:

(a) the topic sentence comes at or near the beginning;
(b) the succeeding sentences explain or establish or develop the statement made in the topic sentence; and
(c) the final sentence either emphasizes the thought of the topic sentence or states some important consequence.

**Ending with a digression, or with an unimportant detail, is particularly to be avoided.**

## Rule 10. Use the active voice.

The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive:

| Passive | Active |
| --- | --- |
| My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me. | I shall always remember my first visit to Boston. |

This rule does not mean that the writer should entirely discard the passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary.

**As a rule, avoid making one passive depend directly upon another:**

| Original | Revision |
| --- | --- |
| Gold was not allowed to be exported. | It was forbidden to export gold. |
| A survey of this region was made in 1900. | This region was surveyed in 1900. |

**The habitual use of the active voice makes for forcible writing:**

| Weak | Strong |
| --- | --- |
| There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground. | Dead leaves covered the ground. |
| The sound of a guitar somewhere in the house could be heard. | Somewhere in the house a guitar hummed sleepily. |
| The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired. | Failing health compelled him to leave college. |
| It was not long before he was very sorry that he had said what he had. | He soon repented his words. |

## Rule 11. Put statements in positive form.

Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, non-committal language. Use the word *not* as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a means of evasion.

| Negative | Positive |
| --- | --- |
| He was not very often on time. | He usually came late. |
| He did not think that studying Latin was much use. | He thought the study of Latin useless. |
| not honest | dishonest |
| not important | trifling |
| did not remember | forgot |
| did not pay any attention to | ignored |
| did not have much confidence in | distrusted |

The reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; he wishes to be told what is.

**The antithesis of negative and positive is strong:**

- Not charity, but simple justice.
- Not that I loved Caesar less, but Rome the more.

## Rule 12. Use definite, specific, concrete language.

Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to the abstract.

| Vague | Specific |
| --- | --- |
| A period of unfavorable weather set in. | It rained every day for a week. |
| He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward. | He grinned as he pocketed the coin. |

The surest method of arousing and holding the attention of the reader is by being specific, definite, and concrete. Critics have pointed out how much of the effectiveness of the greatest writers—Homer, Dante, Shakespeare—results from their constant definiteness and concreteness.

In exposition and in argument, the writer must likewise never lose his hold upon the concrete, and even when he is dealing with general principles, he must give particular instances of their application.

| Abstract | Concrete |
| --- | --- |
| In proportion as the manners, customs, and amusements of a nation are cruel and barbarous, the regulations of their penal code will be severe. | In proportion as men delight in battles, bull-fights, and combats of gladiators, will they punish by hanging, burning, and the rack. |

## Rule 13. Omit needless words.

Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that **he make every word tell**.

| Wordy | Concise |
| --- | --- |
| the question as to whether | whether |
| there is no doubt but that | no doubt (doubtless) |
| used for fuel purposes | used for fuel |
| he is a man who | he |
| in a hasty manner | hastily |
| this is a subject which | this subject |
| His story is a strange one. | His story is strange. |

**In especial the expression *the fact that* should be revised out of every sentence:**

| Original | Revision |
| --- | --- |
| owing to the fact that | since (because) |
| in spite of the fact that | though (although) |
| call your attention to the fact that | remind you (notify you) |
| I was unaware of the fact that | I was unaware that (did not know) |
| the fact that he had not succeeded | his failure |
| the fact that I had arrived | my arrival |

**Who is, which was, and the like are often superfluous:**

| Original | Revision |
| --- | --- |
| His brother, who is a member of the same firm | His brother, a member of the same firm |
| Trafalgar, which was Nelson's last battle | Trafalgar, Nelson's last battle |

**A common violation of conciseness is presenting a single complex idea step by step:**

| Wordy (51 words) | Concise (26 words) |
| --- | --- |
| Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king of Scotland. The witches told him that this wish of his would come true. The king of Scotland at this time was Duncan. Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth murdered Duncan. He was thus enabled to succeed Duncan as king. | Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized the prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king of Scotland in his place. |

## Rule 14. Avoid a succession of loose sentences.

This rule refers especially to loose sentences of a particular type: those consisting of two co-ordinate clauses, the second introduced by a conjunction or relative.

An unskilful writer will sometimes construct a whole paragraph of sentences of this kind, using as connectives *and*, *but*, *so*, and less frequently, *who*, *which*, *when*, *where*, and *while*.

If the writer finds that he has written a series of sentences of this type, he should recast enough of them to remove the monotony, replacing them by simple sentences, by sentences of two clauses joined by a semicolon, by periodic sentences of two clauses, by sentences of three clauses—whichever best represent the real relations of the thought.

## Rule 15. Express co-ordinate ideas in similar form.

This principle, that of parallel construction, requires that expressions of similar content and function should be outwardly similar. The likeness of form enables the reader to recognize more readily the likeness of content and function.

| Non-parallel | Parallel |
| --- | --- |
| Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method, while now the laboratory method is employed. | Formerly, science was taught by the textbook method; now it is taught by the laboratory method. |
| It was both a long ceremony and very tedious. | The ceremony was both long and tedious. |
| A time not for words, but action. | A time not for words, but for action. |
| Either you must grant his request or incur his ill will. | You must either grant his request or incur his ill will. |

By this principle, an article or a preposition applying to all the members of a series must either be used only before the first term or else be repeated before each term.

## Rule 16. Keep related words together.

The position of the words in a sentence is the principal means of showing their relationship. The writer must bring together the words that are related in thought, and keep apart those which are not so related.

| Separated | Together |
| --- | --- |
| Wordsworth, in the fifth book of The Excursion, gives a minute description of this church. | In the fifth book of The Excursion, Wordsworth gives a minute description of this church. |
| There was a look in his eye that boded mischief. | In his eye was a look that boded mischief. |
| All the members were not present. | Not all the members were present. |
| He only found two mistakes. | He found only two mistakes. |

The relative pronoun should come, as a rule, immediately after its antecedent.

Modifiers should come, if possible, next to the word they modify.

## Rule 17. In summaries, keep to one tense.

In summarizing the action of a drama, the writer should always use the present tense. In summarizing a poem, story, or novel, he should preferably use the present, though he may use the past if he prefers.

Whichever tense the writer chooses, he should use throughout. Shifting from one tense to the other gives the appearance of uncertainty and irresolution.

## Rule 18. Place the emphatic words of a sentence at the end.

The proper place in the sentence for the word, or group of words, which the writer desires to make most prominent is usually the end.

| Weak ending | Strong ending |
| --- | --- |
| Humanity has hardly advanced in fortitude since that time, though it has advanced in many other ways. | Humanity, since that time, has advanced in many other ways, but it has hardly advanced in fortitude. |
| This steel is principally used for making razors, because of its hardness. | Because of its hardness, this steel is principally used in making razors. |

The other prominent position in the sentence is the beginning. Any element in the sentence, other than the subject, may become emphatic when placed first.

> Deceit or treachery he could never forgive.

**The principle that the proper place for what is to be made most prominent is the end applies equally to the words of a sentence, to the sentences of a paragraph, and to the paragraphs of a composition.**
