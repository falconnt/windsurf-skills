# Signs of AI Writing

This is a condensed guide based on Wikipedia editors' research into detecting AI-generated content. LLMs have identifiable writing patterns that make their output detectable.

## Regression to the Mean

LLMs produce generic, statistical-average prose. Common patterns:

### Undue Emphasis on Symbolism and Legacy
- Overuse of words like "pivotal," "crucial," "vital," "testament," "enduring legacy"
- Treating ordinary subjects as historically significant
- Inflated importance claims

### Promotional Language
- **Puffery adjectives:** groundbreaking, seamless, robust, cutting-edge, innovative
- **Empty "-ing" phrases:** ensuring reliability, showcasing features, highlighting capabilities, fostering growth
- **Grandiose claims:** revolutionized, transformed, redefined

### Superficial Analyses
- Surface-level treatment of complex topics
- Lack of specific details or evidence
- Generic conclusions that could apply to anything

## Language and Grammar Patterns

### Overused "AI Vocabulary"
Words that appear disproportionately in LLM output:
- delve, leverage, multifaceted, foster, realm, tapestry
- nuanced, intricate, pivotal, testament
- landscape (used metaphorically), journey, navigate
- underscore, bolster, spearhead

### Negative Parallelisms
Structures like "not only X but also Y" used excessively.

### Rule of Three
Overuse of three-item lists: "clarity, precision, and elegance"

### Excessive Synonym Variance
Artificially varying word choice to avoid repetition, resulting in unnatural prose.

### Vague Attributions
- "Many experts believe..."
- "It is widely recognized that..."
- "Studies have shown..."
(Without specific citations)

## Punctuation and Formatting

### Excessive Boldface
Bolding every other phrase or key term.

### Inline-Header Vertical Lists
Converting prose into bulleted lists unnecessarily.

### Emojis
Inappropriate use of emojis in formal writing.

### Overuse of Em Dashes
Using em dashes where commas or periods would suffice.

## Structural Patterns

### Outline-Like Conclusions
- "In conclusion, X represents a significant..."
- "Looking ahead, the future of X..."
- "Challenges remain, but..."

### Summaries That Repeat the Introduction
Conclusions that merely restate opening paragraphs.

### Excessive Section Headers
Breaking short content into many small sections.

## Communication Patterns

### Collaborative Phrasing
- "Let's explore..."
- "We can see that..."
- "It's worth noting that..."

### Knowledge-Cutoff Disclaimers
Unnecessary hedging about information currency.

### Phrasal Templates
- "When it comes to X..."
- "In the realm of..."
- "At its core..."

## What to Do Instead

1. **Be specific, not grandiose.** Say what it actually does.
2. **Use active voice.** "The function returns X" not "X is returned by the function."
3. **Omit needless words.** Cut puffery and filler.
4. **Use concrete language.** "It rained every day for a week" not "A period of unfavorable weather set in."
5. **Avoid promotional adjectives.** Let the work speak for itself.
6. **Write naturally.** Don't artificially vary vocabulary.
7. **Be direct.** State conclusions without excessive hedging.
